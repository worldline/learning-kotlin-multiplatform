### IDE support overview

::: tip

[Fleet](https://www.jetbrains.com/fleet/) is becoming more and more the best IDE to consider for KMP developpement with additional features such as better preview management

Consider also installing [Jetbrain ToolBox](https://www.jetbrains.com/toolbox-app/) for managing multiple versions ( Beta , Alpha , stable) of Android Studio or Fleet

## Hands-on Lab objectives

### Functionnally

We will create a simple quiz application that provides :
- a Startup screen explaining rules of the game
- a Quiz screen looping on single choices questions
- a final scoring screen.

### Technically

- The app can be deployed on Android , iOS and jvm Desktop.
- We will use not only a common library but composable views shared for all platforms


### Design screens

Here are expected screens at the end of this Hands-on Lab.

::: tip
You can generate composables based on designs on Figma thanks to the plugin [Google Relay](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1041056822461507786/Relay-for-Figma). A dedicated section on android developer documentation describe all the steps [here](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/tooling/relay?hl=fr)
